# node_react-native_expo
This README.md provides instructions/links for installing & running expo/react-native on node

<h2>Node Install</h2>
  <p>
  Node is the underlying JS server environment upon which react-native is built and run.  See <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">node.js site</a> for more info. There are a lot of instructions on how to install node out there, but I highly recommend never using anything other than node version manager (nvm).  <code>nvm</code> does by far the best job of controlling all install files, and allows you to quickly and easily switch between versions of node, which comes in handy when dealing with packages that do not work with the newest versions of node.

 <h2>Expo Install</h2>
  <p>
    Expo is a JS framework on top of react-native that allows you to quickly & easily create cross-platform mobile applications using JS.  The instructions here will install both Expo and react-native.
